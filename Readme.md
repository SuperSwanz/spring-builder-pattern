# spring-builder-pattern

This sample app in spring boot showcase the use of builder pattern along with embedded H2 database http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html.

## Getting Started

Git clone the project on your local machine and add it to your workspace

### Prerequisites

For runnning this, you will need
- Java 1.8
- Gradle support - In Eclipse editor, goto help -> eclipse marketplace -> search for buildship (buildship gradle integration) and install it.

## Brief

Builder pattern is used here to send and receive the Json. Jackson is used for serialization/deserialization.
- **UserBuilder**      -> Receives the json from the UI/api and converts that to the object.
- **ErrorBuilder**     -> Builds Error object if there is any server side error.
- **ResponseBuilder**  -> Wraps the response to be send back as a generic response for all methods.
- **GreyResponseEntityExceptionHandler** -> This extends **ResponseEntityExceptionHandler** to throw error/s from Spring controllers. This shows the good way to handle errors in Spring controller.
- **GreyErrorController** -> This implements **ErrorController** which is used to override Spring's default error implementation which throws "Whitelabel error page". The implementaion will return Json in our case.

## Running the app

For running the app,
- Open **application.properties** file and set the "Server Config", "H2 Config", "Datasource Config" as per your choice. No need to change the "Security Config" as spring security is not implemented.
- Once, changes are done in **application.properties**, open **"CommonDesignPatternsApplication.Java"** file and select run/debug.
- If app starts successfull, goto **http://localhost:8080/designs**. Error json will be served as response.
- To create user, do <br />
*POST http://localhost:8080/designs/user/create* <br />
*Content-Type: application/json* <br />
*{"email":"sample@sample.com","firstName":"fName","lastName":"lname"}* <br />
- To get user, do<br />
*GET http://localhost:8080/designs/user/get/sample@sample.com*<br />
*Content-Type: application/json*<br />
- To view H2 database console, goto<br />
*http://localhost:8080/designs/h2*

## Built With

* [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) - The web framework used
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Dependency Management
